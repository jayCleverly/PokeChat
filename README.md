# PokeChat
A Pokemon Go website designed to allow players to communicate about relevant topics over one social media platform.

This project is a prototype of what a Pokemon Go social media site could look like. Currently, the only ways of communicating about the game with other players is through social media sites such as facebook and discord. For those who do not have these apps, there is no official pokemon chat in-game or anywhere else available to use. Therefore, I have developed a simple chat application, allowing users to add friends, create groups and communicate about certain topics.

This project is built with python, using django as a framework. The site can only be accessed on desktop screens, and due to only being a prototype, contains just basic styling.
